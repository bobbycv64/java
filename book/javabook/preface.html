<p> Anyone can program but can they program Object-Oriented? (Eric
Richardson, 1999) </p>

<h3 class="title">Structured Programming</h3>
<p>Information
Technology (IT) and Object-Oriented (OO) Programming didn't exist or
were not known as the popular practice of Structured Programming
(SP).&nbsp; Robert Estey began his computing career in 1985 and his
first
company invested almost $1 Million (United States) Dollars for a
Digital Equipment (DEC) Virtual Address eXtension (VAX) 11/780
state-of-the-art computer with 1 MHz processor, 4 MB of memory, 120 MB
disk drive and a magnetic tape drive.&nbsp; The computer
paradigm at the time was centralized computing with direct RS-232
terminal connections.&nbsp; The popular programming languages were C,
COBOL,
Fortran and Pascal, written to solve simple problems. </p>
<p> While the computing industry was working with Structured
Programming and centralization, the same issues from the past occur
today. How do you correctly analyze, design and produce error free
code to the customer? The answer then, "Hire more programmers." </p>

<h3 class="title">Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
<p> The first Object-Oriented Programming Language (OOPL), Simula was
introduced in 1962, decades before the popular OOPLs Smalltalk 1980 and
C++ in the mid 1980's.&nbsp; Robert Estey with over a decade of
Structured Programming&nbsp; and many SP developers were in for a
paradigm shift to
learn the new architecture and terminology of OO.<br>
</p>

<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Paradigm Shift</h3>
<p> Today the world has a lot of structured code which is harder to
maintain and impossible to develop in a timely manner. Object-Oriented
Programming enables software developers to program dynamically,
distributed, secure, multi-threaded, robust and high performance
applications.<br>
</p>
<p> The World Wide Web (WWW) was one of the first true movements using
Object-Oriented technology.&nbsp; Web Browsers no matter who wrote them
could interpret and display the contents on a world wide stage.&nbsp;
The WWW
was created back in the 1960's but didn't get public awareness until
the early 1990's.&nbsp; In 1995, the Java Programming Language emerged
and
was
accepted as one of the popular Web Programming Languages. </p>

<h3 class="title">Java</h3>
<p> The Java programming language is simple to program and has several
built
in features, e.g. Security, Threads, Object-Oriented design, the most
important feature was TRUE Portability.&nbsp; The Java Virtual Machine
(JVM)
executed on any platform guarantees portability, without recompiling,
regenerating objects or any other inconvience of operating systems.
Java is TRULEY PORTABLE. </p>
<p> C and C++ (Hybrid Object-Oriented C) were popular programming
languages before the birth of the the WWW and have many of the same
features that Java does, however, they didn't have TRUE
PORTABILITY.&nbsp; A C/C++ program didn't necessarily mean that the
same program would work on all platforms.&nbsp; C/C++ code required
rewriting the code, using pre-processor commands or make file
modifications.&nbsp; The C
community realized that there were serious porting issues that the
Portable Operating System Interface eXchange (POSIX) standard was
created.&nbsp; The authors believe that this was to little, to late and
C/C++
missed the WWW by not following a single standard strategy. </p>

<h3 class="title">About This Book</h3>
<p> Chapter 1 is an overview about Object-Oriented Concepts and the
importance before programming Java.&nbsp; Every educational system
always jumps right into Java, which is a shame when the student needed
OO fundamentals.<br>
</p>
<p> Chapter 2 introduces the History of Java, the eleven design goals
and advantages/disadvantages of Java computing.&nbsp; Why the computing
industry, commercial, government, educational and private sectors
embrased
the technology and are moving to the Java programming language.&nbsp;
Chapter
2 also discusses the basics of the Java Virtual Machine and the Java
Programming Environment.&nbsp; This chapter also gives step by step
instructions on how to install the Java Virtual Machine and write your
first Java program, Helloworld.java. </p>
<p> Chapter 3 covers basic Class anatomy, attributes and methods.
Fundamental basics and flow control are also discussed, e.g. for, do,
while. </p>

<h3 class="title">Conventions</h3>
<p> This book will follow the Java programming styles and conventions
as perscribed by the Sun Microsystems Java web site,

<h3 class="title">Let's Begin</h3>
<p> The quote at the begining is a simple statement but needs to be
heeded.&nbsp; This book is going to try and help a first time
programmer or an experienced Structured Programmer into the
Object-Oriented world. Let's put Structured Programming behind and
start thinking Object-Oriented. </p>

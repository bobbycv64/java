View Controller</a></h2>

<p><a name="N4005EC"> In object-oriented programming development, Model
View Controller (MVC) is the name of a methodology or design pattern
for successfully and efficiently relating the user interface to
underlying data models. The MVC pattern is widely used in program
development with programming languages such as Java, Smalltalk, C, and
C++. </a></p>
<p><a name="N4005EC"> The MVC pattern has been heralded by many
developers as a useful pattern for the reuse of object code and a
pattern that allows them to significantly reduce the time it takes to
develop applications with user interfaces. </a></p>
<p><a name="N4005EC"> The model-view-controller pattern proposes three
main components or objects to be used in software development: A Model,
which represents the underlying, logical structure of data in a
software application and the high-level class associated with it. This
object model does not contain any information about the user interface.
A View, which is a collection of classes representing the elements in
the user interface (all of the things the user can see and respond to
on the screen, such as buttons, display boxes and so forth) A
Controller, which represents the classes connecting the model and the
view, and is used to communicate between classes in the model and view.

<p><a name="N4005F5"> Every time the user types a character or pushes a
mouse button, an event occurs. Any object can be notified of the event.
All it has to do is implement the appropriate interface and be
registered as an event listener on the appropriate event source. Swing
components can generate many kinds of events. </a></p>
<p><a name="N4005F5"> Each event is represented by an object that gives
information about the event and identifies the event source. Event
sources are typically components, but other kinds of objects can also
be event sources. As the following figure shows, each event source can
have multiple listeners registered on it. Conversely, a single listener
can register with multiple event sources. </a></p>

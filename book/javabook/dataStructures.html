<p> The Java language has produced several new types of data
structures. The new collections, lists and map classes enable the
language to become more dynamic. We will discuss only Vectors and Hash
Tables in this chapter. </p>

<h2 class="title" style="clear: both;"><a name="N4006DC">11.1. Vectors</a></h2>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name="N4006DC"> Java has the new dynamic concept of a Vector.
Vector's are a collection of objects that can be initially defined and
increase in size dynamically, unlike Arrays which are a fixed size.
Vectors can increase or decrease in size and objects are referred as
elements. </a></p>
<p><a name="N4006DC"> Vectors optimize storage management by
maintaining a capacity and a capacityIncrement. The capacity is always
at least as large as the vector size. The vector's storage increases in
chunks the size of capacityIncrement. Applications increase the
capacity of a vector before inserting a large number of components,
reducing the amount of incremental reallocation. </a></p>

Tables</a></h2>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name="N4006E3"> Hash tables map keys to values. Any non-null
object can be used as a key or as a value. Hash tables store and
retrieve objects using keys. </a></p>
<p><a name="N4006E3"> An instance of Hashtable has two parameters that
affect its performance: initial capacity and load factor. The capacity
is the number of buckets in the hash table, and the initial capacity is
simply the capacity at the time the hash table is created. The load
factor is a measure of how full the hash table is allowed to get before
its capacity is automatically increased. When the number of entries in
the hashtable exceeds the product of the load factor and the current
capacity, the capacity is increased by calling the rehash method. </a></p>

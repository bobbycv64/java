<p>Streams and files are fundamental to most programming tasks. They
are needed for reading input to a program and writing output from the
program. Logging is also a very important task that uses streams. In
the Java Virtual Machine (VM), all streams and files interact with the
host file system for the operating system. To maintain cross platform
compatibility, some OS features may not be available that are native on
that platform. This chapter will give a overview of features,
techniques and examples to get the reader started. Working with streams
is relatively straight forward but the choice of which stream to use
can be daunting as there are so many to choose. It's not as bad as it
seems as you'll see.</p>

Standard Streams</a></h2>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name="N40083C">When UNIX was created, the operating system used a
file as a metaphor for many different purposes. This abstraction turned
out to be quite powerful as devices such as a serial port look just
like a file so they can be opened and read or written to just like a
standard file. The basic unit of execution, a process interacts with
the program running inside it in a standard way. The process makes
available the environment including any variables and command line
arguments, an input stream, output stream, and an error stream. This
interface between the program and the process is the same in C, as it
is in Java. They are named standard IO or standard input, output, and
error respectively.</a></p>

</div>
<p><a name="N40083C">The Java VM is an application running inside the
process. The Java program's byte code that gets interpreted by the VM
has access to the interface supplied by the process through objects
available from the VM and the <tt>main</tt> program command line. Just
to sum up, the process is managed by the operating system. The VM is
managed by the process and the Java program is managed by the VM. Also
consider that security such as file permissions are managed as well by
the VM.</a></p>

</div>
</div>
<p><a name="N400892">This section looks at reading standard input to
the user program. Standard input is the data sent to a program either
through input entered from a keyboard at the command line over via a
pipe in the shell. Also since a Java can be invoked from within a Java
program, one program can feed input to the next. All these are examples
of standard input.</a></p>

</div>
<p><a name="stdin-figure">The above figure shows quite a few concepts
that need to be covered. The <tt>System</tt> has a static field <tt>in</tt>
which is an <tt>InputStream</tt>. Reading from the system in can be
done in a loop and the end of the loop is represented by the integer
-1. The <tt>read</tt> method of all the <tt>InputStream</tt> and
derived classes returns an int. All the streams in this hierarchy are
designed to read bytes and are considered byte streams. The int is cast
to a char since we know the input from the keyboard in character data.
Invoke the program as follows and type some characters and then press
Control-D in Unix to create the end of stream marker.</a></p>

and standard error streams.</a></h3>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name="N4008ED">Standard output and standard error are very
similar to standard input except they are output from the program
rather than input to the program. <tt>System</tt> has two more static
fields named <tt>out</tt> and <tt>err</tt> which are of type <tt>OutputStream</tt>.
Standard output is considered a normal output channel from a program
whereas standard error is an error stream. This is a pretty binary
approach but utilities that output textual or other data are very
important and fit this model. Errors would normally be written to the
console or a error log. Logging systems used in programs tend to allow
different levels of output from info to outright errors. Standard
output tends not to be a part of logging and should be considered real
output from the program.</a></p>
<p><a name="N4008ED">If we look at </a><a href="#stdin-figure"
 title="Figure 13.3. Reading Standard Input.">Figure 13.3</a>, we can
see that the program is really an &#8220;echo&#8221; program where all the input is
echoed to the standard output and in event of error, an error message
is written to standard error as well as the stack trace. This
demonstrates the normal use of the standard output and error streams.

</div>
<p><a name="N400906">Providing a return value is very important to
finish the contract for the standard interface. Programs that may be
run from the command line or called from other Java programs is
different for Java as every class can have a <tt>main</tt> method.
This class can be called directly from Java but the only way to return
a non-zero value from the VM is to call System.exit with a non-zero
argument. This section will show how to make a program that can be
called both from another Java program or the command line that will
behave properly. The following figure is an example.</a></p>
<div class="figure">
<p><a name="N400906"><b>Figure 13.5. Providing a return value.</b></a></p>

<p><a name="N400906">Looking at the previous figure is a case of self
documenting code as the code implements the principles we are trying to
illustrate. The <tt>Main</tt> method can be called directly from Java
and returns the status from the program, success or failure. The <tt>main</tt>
method is called when running the program from the command line and
when the VM exits the status is passed to the shell. In this case the <tt>main</tt>
method just turns around and calls the <tt>Main</tt> method.</a></p>

<div>
<h3 class="title"><a name="N400939">13.3.1. Introduction to streams.</a></h3>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name="N400939">Streams in Java is a big subject. There are more
than forty classes and interfaces combined associated with streams.
This section will work to help clarify the common uses and help with
the selection process.</a></p>
<p><a name="N400939">Character streams were added to Java in version
1.1. These streams are designed to read and write character data such
as text. The type char is a 16-bit Unicode characters. This means that
the character streams are made to handle Unicode and other common
encodings. All character streams derive from <tt>Reader</tt> and <tt>Writer</tt>.
Use these streams when reading and writing character data.</a></p>
<p><a name="N400939">Byte streams make up most of the remainder of the
IO package. These classes derive from <tt>InputStream</tt> and <tt>OutputStream</tt>.
A byte is always 8-bit in Java. The method <tt>read</tt> on <tt>InputStream</tt>
reads one byte into an int of the range 0-255 or returns -1 for end of
stream. An integer is 32-bit in Java so much of the excess space is
unused but this makes it easy for arithmatic operation on a byte and
casting to a byte will not lose data. The classes <tt>DataInputStream</tt>
and <tt>DataOutputStream</tt> were also added in Java 1.1 for
serialization and should be used for reading and writing Java objects
into a file.</a></p>
<p><a name="N400939">There are a couple of other classes worth noting.
The <tt>RandomAccessFile</tt> can be used for reading and writing and
the <tt>FileDescriptor</tt> class has a <tt>sync</tt> method for
making sure the underlying file system has saved the changes made to a
file. You need to use a <tt>RandomAccessFile</tt> or a <tt>FileOutputStream</tt>
class to get a file descriptor. A <tt>OutputStreamWriter</tt> can be
constructed using a <tt>FileOutputStream</tt> object to get this
capability for writer type streams. Buffered stream can help gain
performance for reading and writing files. Create the appropriate
buffered stream from the file stream.</a></p>
<p><a name="N400939">Note: <tt>System.in</tt> is an <tt>InputStream</tt>
and can't be replaced by a reader. In a similar way <tt>System.out</tt>
is a PrintStream which is deprecated and can't be replaced by a
character based PrintWriter. </a></p>

platforms look the same. Java supplies a <tt>File</tt> class that

directories. The following program lists information about a file or a

directory a folder.</a></p>

section looks at Writing to files.</a></p>

</div>
</div>
<p><a name="N4009F8">Writing to files is just the same as writing to
any other. The main two classes to start with are <tt>FileOutputStream</tt>
for byte oriented data and <tt>FileWriter</tt> for char oriented data.
Both have the same constructor which allows a file, file descriptor,
string, or a string and a boolean. The last one is used if you want to
append to the file. Once you have this object created then they can be
used with most of the other streams types that take a output stream or
writer as an argument for their constructor. The follow is an example.</a></p>
<pre class="programlisting"><a name="N4009F8">FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("myfile");<br>DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(fos);<br>// or<br>ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(fos);<br>// or<br>BufferedOutputStream bos = new BufferedOutputStream(fos);<br><br>      </a></pre>
<p><a name="N4009F8">One of the three types of streams above could be
used depending on the type of output desired. <tt>ObjectOutputStream</tt>
is used for serializing objects. <tt>DataOutputStream</tt> for
platform independent data and the buffered stream can be used by itself
or chained to the <tt>ObjectOutputStream</tt> or the <tt>DataOutputStream</tt>
just as it is chained to the <tt>FileOutputStream</tt> above. Chaining
is the name of the pattern shown here where one object uses another in
this manner.</a></p>
<p><a name="N4009F8">The next example shows the chaining of Writers.</a></p>
<pre class="programlisting"><a name="N4009F8">FileWriter fw = new FileWriter("myfile");<br>PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(fw);<br>// or<br>BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(fw);<br>      </a></pre>
<p><a name="N4009F8">Depending on the application, one of these writers
could work better than the other. A <tt>PrintWriter</tt> can be used
with <tt>System.out</tt> as an argument to the constructor and works
the same as the deprecated <tt>PrintStream</tt>. This class does not
throw exceptions so a <tt>checkError()</tt> method is provided to
check for errors that may occur.</a></p>

<p><a name="N400A2A">The classes to read from a URL are really part of
the <span class="emphasis"><i>java.net</i></span> package but reading
from a remote URL is as easy as reading from an input stream. The
following example illustrates this point.</a></p>
